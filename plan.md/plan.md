home- select character class, which is a ship, enter name.
directs to flatplane aka hanger for accessing other space manifolds.
menu allows user to select a manifold. then user travels to manifold- ship conforms to a shape aka time value.
certain time values in that manifold allow user to access other manifolds of that same time value.
button to get back to flatplane exists.
on the manifold you have to create a tunnel back to the flatplane by choosing the proper button.
if proper button is chosen, button to direct back to flatplane appears.
othewise the only other option is to jump to a manifold with the same time value.
